DDT is a human-manufactured chemical fertilizer that was originally used to control the rampant spread of diseases and later used for agricultural purposes. Though originally thought to have beneficial effects, the chemical proved to be detrimental to both the environment and human life in general. It was originally thought to be a guard against the mosquito-spread diseases and also stop the harmful pests creeping into the the agricultural farmlands. DDT is believed to affect the soil structure drastically wherein a large number of fauna in the soil die because of ingestion of DDT in their bodies.
